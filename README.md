Adventures in Foon
==================

This project is an ode to one of my favorite podcasts: Hello from the Magic Tavern. It is not affiliated with the show in any way. (not that i'm against that happening - just saying)

I take no credit for what the brilliant, twisted minds of the artists have created; I am merely expressing my affection for said creation with a bit of 8bit, JRPG-esque fan fic.
